https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0930209/bio	"This perky, talented, blue-eyed redhead had acting aspirations from the get-go. She was born in Brooklyn on June 29, 1925, as Bernice Kamiat, to an Austrian Jewish father and a Russian Jewish mother. Cara began performing as a child and continued into her teens. After her parents' divorce, she relocated with her mother to Hollywood where she attended the Hollywood Professional School and lent her voice to both radio and animated cartoon shorts. At age 16 she was signed by 20th Century-Fox and began to play minor, often unbilled parts in drama, comedy and musicals billing herself as Bernice Kay.Throughout WWII she was always reliable for adding a little pep and zing to her smallish roles. She played various shapely secretaries, salesgirls, girlfriends, etc. in such minor fodder as Wide Open Town (1941), Happy Land (1943), In the Meantime, Darling (1944) and Don Juan Quilligan (1945), but nothing to propel her into the front ranks.Things started picking up in the post-war years. She made a splash on stage in a production of ""Born Yesterday"" and started earning notably feisty, tart-tongued roles in such films as Boomerang! (1947) and The Saxon Charm (1948). By the 1950s she showed scene-stealing potential in The Girl Next Door (1953) and The Helen Morgan Story (1957), and finally earned an Academy Award nomination for her sad, touching support turn as a widowed mother in the classic The Defiant Ones (1958) opposite Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. This led to a couple of flashy gangster moll roles in the film comedies Never Steal Anything Small (1959) and The Man from the Diners' Club (1963).The sitcom December Bride (1954) starring Spring Byington had deadpan quipster Harry Morgan stealing many scenes griping about scatterbrained wife Gladys (who was never shown on camera). When Morgan moved into his own spinoff series, Gladys was finally revealed in the form of Cara on the initially popular Pete and Gladys (1960) TV show. The program did not last as long as it deserved (two seasons) but the dusky-voiced Cara came off well and was escorted directly into her own series The Cara Williams Show (1964) with the equally personable Frank Aletter at her side. Molded at this time by the CBS powers-that-be as the next wacky redhead to follow in the comedy heels of Lucille Ball, the plans quickly went askew following an unfavorable network power shuffle and the canceling of her sitcom after only one season. With her momentum completely gone, her career went into rapid decline. She did manage a steady role on the first season of Rhoda (1974), and an affecting dramatic turn in the ensemble film soaper Doctors' Wives (1971). By the 1980s, however, she had officially retired.A turbulent 1950s marriage to actor John Drew Barrymore (who later became the father of actress Drew in a subsequent marriage) produced son John Blyth Barrymore who went into acting as well and appeared in a bit role in his mother's last film The One Man Jury (1978). Cara subsequently married a Beverly Hills realtor (her third husband) and later displayed a strong business acumen in interior designing and as a champion poker player. She also has one child from her first marriage."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756686/bio	Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born into a family of old provincial nobility. Failing his final exams at a preparatory school, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts to study architecture. In 1921, he began military service in the 2nd Regiment of Chasseurs, and sent to Strasbourg for pilot training. The next year, he obtained his license, and was offered a transfer to the air force. But his fiancée's family objected, so he settled in Paris and took an office job. His engagement ultimately broke off, and he worked at several jobs over the next few years without success.By 1926, he was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight in the days when aircrafts had few instruments and pilots flew by the seat of their pants. He worked on the Aéropostale between Toulouse and Dakar. His first tale, L'Aviateur (The Aviator), was published in the magazine Le Navire d'Argent. In 1928, he published his first book, Courrier-Sud (Southern Mail), and flew the Casablanca/Dakar route. He became the director of Cap Juby airfield in Rio de Oro, Sahara. In 1929, he moved to South America where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina Company. In 1931, Vol de Nuit (Night Flight), which won the Prix Femina, was published. He married Salvadoran artist and writer Consuelo Suncin Sandoval de Gómez, who became the model for the temperamental Rose in Le Petit Prince. Theirs was a stormy union as Saint-Exupéry traveled frequently and indulged in numerous affairs.During World War II, he was in New York City, but returned to France to join a squadron based in the Mediterranean. Now 44, he agreed to collect data on German troop movements in the Rhone River Valley. He took off the night of July 31, 1944, and was never seen again. A lady reported having seen a plane crash around noon on August 1st near the Bay of Carqueiranne. A body wearing a French uniform was found several days later, and buried. In 1998, a fisherman found a silver chain bracelet south of Marseille which was identified as being Saint-Exupéry's. On April 7, 2004, officials confirmed that the wreckage of a Lockheed Lightning P-38 found on the seabed off the coast of Marseille in 2000 was Saint-Exupéry's.Further research in 2006 by the dive team which recovered the wreckage located a German pilot who was flying a mission at the Bay of Carqueiranne at the time Saint-Exupéry's plane went down. Horst Rippert acknowledged that he shot at the plane, but did not report it, possibly because he was not sure he actually downed it. When the Germans heard American radio broadcasts that Saint-Exupéry was missing, Rippert said he knew that the plane he downed was his. Rippert idolized Saint-Exupéry, read all his books, and had been bothered by the incident his whole life. He told the dive team he would not have shot at the plane had he known it was Saint-Exupéry's.
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005794/bio	"Mellor began his career in the photographic labs at Paramount in the mid-20's. By 1934, he had graduated to full-time director of photography, working primarily on the studio's lesser productions. At the same time, he continued to serve his apprenticeship by assisting veteran cinematographer Victor Milner as first camera operator on A-grade features. Mellor left Paramount in 1943, to join the U.S. Army Photographic Unit, shooting documentary wartime footage under the aegis of director George Stevens.After the war, Mellor found regular work with most of the major studios: United Artists (1946, 1948-49), Universal (1947-48), MGM (1950-54) and 20th Century Fox (1957-62). He acquired a solid reputation for versatility across every genre of filmmaking. He excelled at outdoor and location photography, best exemplified by William A. Wellman's austere black & white pioneering saga Westward the Women (1951), and Anthony Mann's powerful revenge western The Naked Spur (1953). In stark contrast, Mellor (working again with George Stevens), also shot the black & white melodrama A Place in the Sun (1951) (with John F. Seitz), using diffuse lighting and soft focus lenses. The romantic look of the film with its lingering close-ups, contributed to the New York Times (August 29, 1951) reviewing the picture as ""a work of beauty, tenderness, power and insight"". In the same vein, the Stevens-directed Giant (1956), with its sweeping vistas, and the lush, warm look of Peyton Place (1957), offer nothing like the suitably harsh, barren desert visuals of Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), shot in widescreen Panavision.Mellor died from a heart attack while filming The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) (Stevens again the director) and was replaced by Loyal Griggs. While the film was not a commercial success, its stylized visuals nonetheless garnered Mellor a posthumous Oscar nomination."

After focusing his grade school years on the development of his talents through varied experiences in musical theatre and upon the classical stage, as well as within the realms of visual art, voice-over, dance, screen writing, and instrumental music, he migrated north to attend an internationally renown conservatory of performing arts, The Cleveland Institute of Music, for a foundation year of training and then took to New York City to begin his career, where he worked under the sharp eye and tutelage of Ruth Kulerman, a Juilliard graduate, English-schooled actress and Princeton University professor of Literature running an incredibly selective private studio after her over 5 decades of work in Motion Picture and on the Broadway and West End stages. Steven is a specialist in historic and period performance and has a decade of stunt, historic and modern firearms handling, equestrian, and stage fight training to supplement his now nearly sixteen years of acting and classical & contemporary music study.Mr. Andrews cut his teeth on an intensive 30-day shoot in West Virginia as one of twelve principal background performers forming a trusted unit of reusable near-camera military personnel to fill scenes in J.J. Abrams' throwback thriller 'Super 8', during which he had hours of immersion training and the opportunity to form lasting friendships with members of the cast and crew, a number of whom affectionately referred to him as ""Doc Hollywood"" after the lesser known 1991 Micheal J. Fox picture. And now in 2015 he makes his Major Motion Picture Principal debut opposite Rooney Mara in 'Carol', acclaimed director Todd Haynes' forthcoming adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel ""The Price of Salt"" also starring Cate Blanchette, Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1283446/bio	"In the pre-steroids era, the most fearsome home-run hitter in the American League not named Babe Ruth (Mickey Mantle was a switch-hitter) was named Harmon Killebrew. The surname seemed to fit, as the husky Harmon certainly ""killed"" the ball, launching many massive moon-shots in old-time ball-yards that took the breath away of fans, both home and away. His nickname in baseball, fittingly, was ""The Killer"". Since 1934 (when the Babe went over to the National League Boston Braves, no other player has hit more home runs in the American League than has Killebrew, and only Hammering Hank Aaron, and the Say-Hey Kid ('Willie Mays' (qv in the National League and the dual-league Frank Robinson (Robby won Most Valuable Player Awards in both the National League with the Reds and in the A.L. with the Orioles) surpass him in total number of circuit clouts until the first of the new lively ball sluggers, Mark McGwire, overcame him in 2001.Harmon Killebrew led the American League six times in home-runs and finished in the top three four other times during his 22-year career. Signed as a bonus baby by the Washington Senators, the precursor to the Twins, he first graced a major league roster in 1954, when he was 18. Under then-extant major league baseball rules, bonus babies like Killebrew and the Brooklyn Dodgers' Sandy Koufax had to be kept on a major league roster. Killebrew didn't finally come into his own until 1959, when the 23-year old slugged 42 dingers to win his first home-run crown after just 13 games and hitting none the year before.All but one year of Killebrew's career mostly was spent with the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins (the team was relocated to Minneapolis in 1961). Ironically, it was in one of his off-years, when he only played 113 games and slugged only 25 home runes, that Killebrew and the Twins made it the 1965 World Series. They lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers team of fabled pitchers Don Drysdale and (former Bonus Baby and all-time great) Sandy Koufax. Killebrew's Twins also won two divisional titles, in 1969 under manager Billy Martin (when Killebrew won his only Most Valuable Player Award, leading the A.L with 49 home runs and 140 R.B.I.) and in 1970.In 1973, the 37-year-old Killebrew was injured and played in only 69 games, and his power was gone. He was the oldest player still active in the American League at the age of 38 in 1974, his last with the Twins, and in 1975, when he played out his string with the Kansas City Royals.Killebrew's 573 home runs ranks him #2 all-time in the A.L. behind Ruth and ahead of Reggie Jackson, his partner in a Minnesota car dealership. For one year, in 1972 when he surpassed Mickey Mantle on the All-Time list of major league home run hitters, he was ranked #4 in Major League Baseball's record books, before being surpassed by Frank Robinson the following year. Thereafter, for a generation, Killebrew ranked as the #5 home run hitter in big league ball from 1974 through 2000. What is remarkable was that his accomplishment was done during what is now referred to as the ""Second Dead-Ball Era"" of the 1960s, when pitchers had the upper hand over hitters, and batting averages were much lower than they are now.Despite his awesome slugging and 1,584 career R.B.I., the keepers of the flame of baseball immortality, the Base-Ball Writers of America, kept Killebrew out of the Hall of Fame for five years, holding his low career batting average of .256 against him. Finally, justice was served and ""The Killer"" was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068074/bio	Born in Chicago on June 29, 1964, Bradley Phillip Bell is one of three children born to legendary television pioneers, Lee Phillip Bell, an Emmy Award-winning broadcast journalist and talk show personality, and the late Emmy Award- winning William J. Bell who created of the most popular daytime dramas ever. After graduating from the Chicago Latin School, Bradley Bell attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and concluded his studies at UCLA, majoring in television production.Beginning in 1984 Bradley Bell started his career in writing. Taught by his father and serving as an unofficial member of the writing staff of The Young and the Restless (1973) writing breakdowns and scripts, Bell was integral in the creation and launch of The Bold and the Beautiful (1987). After serving on the writing team since the first episode, Bell was promoted to associate producer in 1989 and again to supervising producer in 1992. He took the reins from his father and became head writer in 1993 - after an extended 6-month trial co-written by his dad in 1992 - and then executive producer in 1995. He has remained in those positions ever since - amassing to one of the longest tenures in television. It wasn't until 2000 that Bradley Bell received his first Daytime Emmy Award nomination. By 2015, he has been awarded with three Emmys (2010, 2013, 2015) for his writing amongst 11 nominations and took home three statues for helming the Best Drama Series in a record three consecutive years (2009, 2010, 2011) amongst 9 nominations in addition to two Emmy wins in other categories.Under Bell's leadership, The Bold And The Beautiful vaulted from the sixth-rated daytime drama to the third-ranked series during the 1992-1993 season. Today, the show is firmly established as the second-highest-ranked daytime serial only behind its sister show The Young and the Restless in the United States amassing now-stable viewership numbers of around 4 million viewers every day. The show continues to be a worldwide phenomenon in such diverse markets as Italy, Australia or South Africa. Bell has continued with his father's tradition of story-telling whilst adding an edge and glamor to his show as writer and kept an extremely stable production and behind-the-scenes-staff resulting in a stunning 21st century look with regular locations shoots (around the globe) and permanent outdoors sets on the studio-lot on a very much stream-lined filming schedule. On January 14, 2015 CBS Television City, celebrating 7000 episodes of The Bold and The Beautiful, dedicated Studio 31 - home of the show since it's inception in 1987 - to Bell in honor of his work.Bell has been married to fellow Chicagoan Colleen Bell since October 1991, and is the proud father of Bradley Chasen, Caroline Catherine, Charlotte Cordelia and Oliver Phillip.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1438907/bio	Ari Zagaris is a recent transplant to Los Angeles from his hometown neighborhood of the Haight/Ashbury in San Francisco. The son of model Kristin Sundbom and sports/ rock'n'roll photographer Michael Zagaris, Ari spent most of his childhood following his father around from the clubhouse of the Oakland A's to the backstage dressing room of The Clash. As a result, his life was a wash of sports and the arts and Ari spent most of his childhood trying to decide whether his life would be spent on the stage or on the playing field. In high school he had to choose between baseball and the arts. Thanks to a heavy sinker and a nasty forkball, baseball won out and the arts were put on hold until a later date. Despite being unable to perform in any school productions, Ari managed to squeeze in classes at A.C.T. before leaving for college on a baseball scholarship. Even while attending The George Washington University, Ari continued to indulge his passion for film, spending most of his free time in the drama department and writing screenplays. Directly after graduating from GW with a BA in Communication, Ari was signed by the Boston Red Sox. While theater and film still ruled his heart, he spent the next few months pitching for the Sox in the minor leagues. After being released by the club, Ari was determined to focus the rest of his life to the craft he had juggled since birth.Ari is a truly versatile actor who's working his way to becoming one of Hollywood's busiest new talents. Tall, with thick eyebrows and an ever-present hangdog countenance, Ari has always remained interested in pursuing offbeat, even eccentric projects. In his lighter performances, the quirky, lanky actor combines relaxed, naturalistic dialogue delivery with impeccable comic timing. In his darker roles Ari is often seen as a rugged, sullen looking leading man with cynical fatalistic outlooks and anti-hero charisma. In the brief moments when he's not in front of the camera, Ari can be found at the nearest baseball diamond reliving his dreams of sports stardom.
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0480046/bio	A former magazine illustrator, Harry Lachman traveled to Paris in 1911 to begin an art career, and soon became recognized as a first-rate post-Impressionist painter. Decorated for his contributions to art by the French government, Lachman afterwards became a set designer at a film studio in Nice. In 1925 American director Rex Ingram hired him as an assistant director on Mare Nostrum (1926) and soon thereafter Lachman gave up his painting career and traveled to England to began a career as a film director. He returned to France and made several films, then journeyed to the U.S. in 1933 and settled in Hollywood. Mainly given B-pictures, his best films were a Laurel and Hardy comedy, Our Relations (1936), and Dante's Inferno (1935), where his painter's eye was evident in the intense ten-minute hell sequence.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643887/bio	Miki Odagiri is known primarily for her important and timeless role as the upbeat office girl in Akira Kurosawa's classic Ikiru opposite Takashi Shimura, whose character is dying of cancer, and Miki, as Toyo Odagiri, inspires him to live... just by being herself: bubbly, spontaneous, and optimistic. Her character is also filled with blunt sarcasm that was extremely rare in movies of the early-1950's. Perhaps Miki and Takashi's most memorable scene is when she's telling him the nicknames she created for their fellow workmates... including his! Sadly, beyond Ikiru, finding the handful of other Japanese movies she appeared in, especially on DVD or Blu Ray, is extremely difficult. But she left an impression in what's considered not only one of the legendary Kurosawa's greatest achievements, but one of the best movies ever made, worldwide.

He gained notoriety with a series of mixes in the early 1990s before recording his 17-minute epic ""Entropy"" in 1991. He signed to James Lavelle's Britain-based Mo Wax Records shortly afterwards and recorded the classic single ""In/Flux"" in 1993, followed by the epic 4-part EP ""What Does Your Soul Look Like"" in 1995. It was 1997's ""Endtroducing..."" that gave Shadow considerable exposure. The album, a series of sample-driven melodic compositions, illustrated hip-hop sampling at its finest, a style that is at odds with such performers as 'Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs'  and M.C. Hammer. The album was a critical favorite, making several end-of-the-year best-of lists. Shortly thereafter, the ""Preemptive Strike"" album was released, which featured ""In/Flux"" and ""What Does Your Soul Look Like?"" which had been previously unavailable in the states, as well as two new singles.

Currently, Shadow is overseeing projects for Quannum Projects, his Northern California-based legion of producers and MCs, which features Blackilicious, Latryx, and Shadow himself."
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1401084/bio	Amy Brown's performance career has encompassed stage and screen, acting, dance, and song. In addition to starring in several independent feature films, short and student films, television, and industrials, she has frequently performed in theatre and burlesque shows. Amy's best-known film to date is The Rockville Slayer, a thriller starring Joe Estevez and scream queen legend Linnea Quigley. In this internationally-distributed film, Amy has a supporting role as an escaped mental patient. Her last feature was Take-Away Spirit, a Chinese ghost and vampire movie for New York's One Shot Productions.Amy began acting in school productions and community theatre in Waco, Texas. Her interest in acting deepened in high school, when she had leading roles in plays such as The Odd Couple (Female Version) by Neil Simon and the title role in David Mamet's The Poet and the Rent. An early highlight was the Holocaust drama No Fading Star, in which Amy played a Jewish boy hiding in a convent while preparing for his Bar Mitzvah. For this challenging role, Amy adopted a masculine look and learned to speak passages in Hebrew. She fondly recalls when, at a state one-act play competition, she alarmed several people when entering the girls' restroom while in costume.Amy spent a year at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where her favorite experience was acting in renowned director Mark Lord's surrealistic production of Strindberg's A Dream Play. However, homesickness brought Amy back to Texas and she completed her BFA degree in acting (graduating summa cum laude) at Texas Christian University, studying under such respected teachers as Forrest Newlin, George Brown, and Margaret Loft. Performance highlights there included the role of Sister Martha in Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac and dual leading roles in the gender-bending student production Breakfast Serial, in which Amy played a male serial killer who preys upon younger boys. Another experience was performing in Andy Dick's Circus of Freaks, a disturbing stage show directed by and starring the controversial TV star Andy Dick. Amy also forayed into directing with Djuna Barnes's The Dove. She was a founding member of New Studio Theatre, a group of students who explored avant-garde, surrealist, and Dadaist plays and writings, focusing on the theories of Antonin Artaud. The group gave some memorable performances before disbanding due to artistic differences.Although her background was in theatre, the majority of Amy's professional acting career has been in film. In addition to a mental patient, her roles have included an amnesiac pursued by a hit-man (Dawn of Twilight), a woman tormented by a killer (Mute), a goth girl (Caffeine Headache), smart-mouthed artist (Getting To Know You), leukemia patient (an award-winning performance in Diva Star), 300-year-old witch (Dr. Deadly's Theatre of Horrors), vampire victim (Blood Party), accidental murderer/zombie victim (How To Dig Your Own Grave), cheerleader (Pot Zombies), murderous housewife (You Can Have It!), French translator (The Sadness Will Last Forever), and Natalie Portman fan (Fandom). She has also lent her voice-over talents to several nationally-aired anime cartoon shows. Amy studied film acting with Michele Condrey at R.E.A.C.T. in Dallas (where she was named the studio's top actor for summer 2004).Amy returned to the stage to star in Goose Dance in Fort Worth and the Comedy Killers murder mysteries in Dallas. She has worked with the Rose Marine and Hip Pocket Theatres and the Butterfly Connection. She was an original member of a popular burlesque troupe. Never losing her passion for the dark and avant-garde, she hopes to focus her career in independent projects that will surprise, disturb, and deeply affect the audience. She is fluent in French and is an amateur pianist and harpsichordist. Her hobbies include art, web design, watching Seinfeld and Star Wars, and caring for her many cats. A vegetarian since age thirteen, Amy is an adamant supporter of animal rights.

Both of the projects were pitched for film festivals.Shortly after turning seventeen, Sophie was cast in a small supporting role by Grammy-nominated DJ and brother of Spike Jonze, Sam I (A.K.A Sam Spiegel). This short filmed was called Heaven (2020). Alongside double Academy-Award nominee Catherine Keener, and the film's namesake & dancing extraordinaire Nevaeh Meraz, the film showcases Meraz's own experiences and love of dance. It was released in late October to great critical review and praise."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866558/bio	"You'd think with a last name like that, character player Andrew Tombes was doomed to play gravediggers in horrors or coroners in crime drama. Not usually, and when he did, it was often played for laughs. Born June 29, 1885 in Ohio, he was an athletic sort who played a lively, talented game of college baseball at Phillips-Exeter Academy but the dreams of entertaining quickly took over. As a performer he started things off in minstrels and musical revues, and appeared notably as a vaudevillian comic. Appearances in ""Flo-FLo (1908), The College Girls"" (1909), ""Miss 1917"" (1917) and ""Poor Little Ritz Girl"" (1920) led to the really big time for a comedian -- Ziegfeld. He slayed 'em as a star headliner in the Ziegfeld Follies in the 1920s, and played a wide range of squirrely parts in everything from Shakespeare to screwball farce. It was friend 'Will Rogers' from his old Follies days, who invited Tombes, at age 50, to settle in Hollywood as a prime featured performer in Rogers' film vehicle Doubting Thomas (1935). Thereafter at Fox he played the quintessentially bald, bemused and bug-eyed executive, professor, police captain, movie mogul or school administrator, but the parts got smaller and smaller. He went on to freelance in scores of featherweight ""B"" movies, often uncredited, mostly musicals and/or comedies. On the funereal side, he did play a dour undertaker's assistant in the Hope/Crosby vehicle Road to Morocco (1942) and a mortician in The Mad Ghoul (1943). True to form, his last movie role was in a comedy, the forgettable The Go-Getter (1956). He died about two decades later at the age of 90 in New York City."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766912/bio	This pretty, blonde 1940s B-movie starlet was the daughter of newspaperman Leonard Sanders and showgirl Blanche Thompson (who also appeared in a few silent pictures). By her own account, she was born in Hollywood as Nancy Lou Sanders on June 29 1925, the day of the Santa Barbara earthquake. Curiously, being in the movies had not been her primary career choice when she was spotted dancing at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub by journeyman actor and talent scout Don Dillaway. Dillaway took an instant shine to Nancy and managed to arrange a screen test at RKO. She passed muster and was rewarded with a six-month contract (being an experienced equestrian from the age of eight also helped clinch the deal). Before long, she found herself on the cover of Life magazine -- along with Jane Greer and Martha Hyer -- as one of 'nine hopefuls'. After five pictures, RKO dropped her option and Nancy moved over to Columbia where she went on to appear in no less than thirteen pictures in 1947 alone. Many of these were horse operas, including half a dozen of the Durango Kid series with Charles Starrett, shot at the Columbia ranch in Burbank. Nancy also doubled for Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shanghai (1947) (wearing a blonde wig) and The Loves of Carmen (1948) (dressed as a gypsy). She was Gerald Mohr's leading lady in The Lone Wolf in London (1947) and popped up in a few Three Stooges comedies which she later said to have really enjoyed being in. When her Hollywood career began to falter in the early 50s, Nancy found work as a tour booking agent with Air Cal Airlines. In 1996, she came out of retirement for occasional TV guest appearances. She was predeceased by her husband of 43 years, a sales rep for Seagram and Jim Bean.

Unable to afford a teacher, he learned by imitating opera recordings. At age 14 he worked as a telephone operator in a Philadelphia iron foundry. He sold newspaper advertising and performed in amateur musicals. Dr. Edouard Lippe coached him and loaned him the money to study in Dresden and Paris. He gave his first concert recital in 1928 in Philadelphia. In 1933 he did 18 encores for an audience that included an assistant to MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer, who signed him to a seven-year contract. After MGM acting lessons and initial trials, his first real success came as the Yankee scout to Jeanette MacDonald's French princess in Naughty Marietta (1935), a huge box-office success made on a small budget. Eddy and MacDonald were paired twice more (Rose-Marie (1936), Maytime (1937)) when Metropolitan Opera star Grace Moore was unavailable; they became an institution. Their last work together was in 1942. Critics nearly always panned his acting. He did have a large radio following (his theme song: ""Short'nin Bread""). In 1959 Eddy and MacDonald issued a recording of their movie hits which sold well. In 1953 he had a fairly successful nightclub routine with Gale Sherwood which ran until his death in 1967.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0218490/bio	A dark, exotic beauty, Katherine DeMille was a fascinating screen presence in the 1930s and 1940s. She was born in Canada to a Scottish schoolteacher, Edward Gabriel Lester, and his Italian-Swiss wife, Cecile Bianca Bertha (Colani) Lester. Her father was killed in France during World War I, and her mother, who was terminally ill, traveled to California to find Katherine's paternal grandparents and leave her with them. Mrs. Lester died before she could contact her in-laws and Katherine was placed in a Los Angeles orphanage. Constance Adams, the wife of Hollywood's top filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, was a director of the orphanage. The DeMilles were moved by Katherine's misfortune and decided to adopt her. She became a member of a family that also included the DeMilles' only natural child, Cecilia de Mille; another adopted child, John de Mille; and Richard de Mille, who was actually DeMille's nephew.Katherine was educated at the Hollywood School for Girls and the Santa Barbara School for Girls. She loved acting in school plays and eventually found work as a movie extra, using the stage name Kay Marsh. DeMille, aware of his daughter's dream of becoming a star, hired her as a script supervisor for his film Four Frightened People (1934) and permitted her to visit the sets of his films and watch his editing process. She secretly auditioned for the role of Pancho Villa's wife, Rosita Morales, in the MGM production Viva Villa! (1934), starring Wallace Beery in the title role. She won the role and impressed the critics with her performance and beauty. Her portrayal of a Mexican maid in The Trumpet Blows (1934) earned her a contract with Paramount Pictures, and she was cast as the villain in Mae West's Belle of the Nineties (1934). Her ability to succeed in films on her own helped her gain her father's admiration as well as a featured role in his next epic, The Crusades (1935). She played Alice, Princess of France, and competed with Loretta Young's Berengaria for the love (and title as consort) of Richard the Lionheart (Henry Wilcoxon). The critics appreciated Katherine's talent and appearance in the lavish DeMille production. Her career was ascending.After her excellent work in the prestigious DeMille picture, Katherine was finally elevated to leading lady status. Paramount starred her in Drift Fence (1936) and Sky Parade (1936). She was also loaned out to MGM for an uncredited appearance as Romeo's first love, Rosaline, in Romeo and Juliet (1936). 20th Century-Fox cast her in a supporting role in the Barbara Stanwyck-Joel McCrea starrer Banjo on My Knee (1936) and gave her second billing in Charlie Chan at the Olympics (1937). Katherine fell in love with Mexican actor Anthony Quinn and married him in 1937. She was billed third in The Californian (1937) and appeared in Love Under Fire (1937), a Spanish Civil War drama. At Columbia Pictures, she was billed second in the Jack Holt vehicle Under Suspicion (1937). This was followed by a small role in another Spanish Civil War drama, Blockade (1938), and a leading lady role in another Jack Holt vehicle, Trapped in the Sky (1939). Unfortunately, the big studios failed to showcase her talent in notable productions. Her next roles were featured in B movies: In Old Caliente (1939), Isle of Destiny (1940), Ellery Queen, Master Detective (1940), and Dark Streets of Cairo (1940). She returned to Paramount for a role in the Technicolor film Aloma of the South Seas (1941).The Quinns had five children.

Born on June 29, 1901 in Edinburgh, the Scots-born actress who began acting on stage, did not arrive in Hollywood until age 34 (then considered too late for leading lady roles) but managed to settle fairly comfortably on the supporting sidelines in chic melodramas and tearjerkers.Born Frieda Rowell Wightman, she was the daughter of Scots-born journalist John ""Jock"" Wightman and actress Elaine Inescourt, who was of German and Polish descent. Her parents initially met when her father came to review a play her mother was appearing in. They married in 1899 but eventually parted ways while Frieda was still young. Her impulsive mother, who had strong designs on a theater career and placed it high on her priority list, sent young Frieda off to live with other families and in boarding schools in England and Wales while she avidly pursued her dreams. Although her parents divorced in 1911, with her father charging her mother with abandonment and adultery, Frieda ended up moving to the United States with her mother. Again, when Elaine found occasional roles in touring shows, Frieda wound up being carted off to convents or boarding schools.Mother and daughter eventually returned to London following World War I, and the young girl, now solely on her own, managed to find employment as a personal secretary to British Member of Parliament Waldorf Astor (2nd Viscount Astor), who was then Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. She also assisted the American-born Lady Nancy Astor, the second woman elected to the UK House of Commons and the first to take her seat there. While accompanying Lady Astor on a trip to the United States in July 1919, Frieda decided to stay in the States and terminated her position with the Astors. In New York she continued finding secretarial work that supported both her and her unemployed-actress mother. She worked at one point with the British consulate in New York.Noticing a number of American actors cast in British parts on Broadway, Frieda was encouraged in the early 1920s to test the waters out, as British actresses were in short supply. By chance, she was introduced to producer-director Winthrop Ames, who gave the unseasoned hopeful a small but showy role in his Broadway comedy ""The Truth About Blayds"" (1922). The play turned out to be a hit. Playwright Philip Barry caught her stage performance and offered her a starring role in his upcoming comedy production ""You and I"". The show proved to be another winner and Frieda, a star on the horizon, finally saw the end of her days as part of a secretarial pool.For the rest of that decade, she alternated between stage comedy and drama and became a vital force on Broadway with prominent roles in ""The Woman on the Jury"" (1923), ""The Fake"" (1924), ""Hay Fever"" (1925), ""Mozart"" (1926), ""Trelawny of the Wells"" (1926) and ""Escape"" (1927). Frieda's happenstance into acting and her sudden surge of success purportedly triggered deep envy and jealousy within her mother, who was unemployed. This led to a bitter and long-term estrangement between the two that never managed to heal itself. (Elaine died in 1964.) While working in the late 1920s as an assistant at Putnam's Publishing Company in New York, Frieda met assistant editor Ben Ray Redman. They married in 1926 and Redman later became a literary critic for the New York Herald Tribune. Frieda, in the meantime, continued to resonate on the New York and touring stage with such plays as ""Springtime for Henry"" and ""When Ladies Meet"".For over a decade, Frieda had resisted the cinema, having turned down several offers in silent and early talking films. When her husband was offered a job with Universal Studios as a literary adviser and author, however, and the couple had to relocate to Hollywood, she decided to take a difference stance. Discovered by a talent scout while performing in a Los Angeles play, Frieda was signed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company and made her debut supporting Fredric March and Merle Oberon in the dewy-eyed drama The Dark Angel (1935), for which she received attractive notices and rare sympathy as the secretary of a blind author (played by March).She did not stay long at Goldwyn, however, and went on to freelance for various other studios. During the course of her movie career, Frieda could be quite charming on the screen playing a wronged woman (as she did in Give Me Your Heart (1936)), but she specialized in haughtier hearts and played them older and colder than she really was off-camera. She soon gained a classy reputation for both her benign and haughty sophisticates. After Warner Bros. signed her up, she showed promise in Another Dawn (1937), Call It a Day (1937) and The Great O'Malley (1937), all 1937 releases. After this, however, her studio lost interest in her career and loaned her out more and more to other studios. Some of these films were leads -- including the ""B""-level Woman Doctor (1939) opposite Henry Wilcoxon, A Woman Is the Judge (1939) with Otto Kruger, Shadows on the Stairs (1941) co-starring Paul Cavanagh, and, in particular, the title role in Portia on Trial (1937). For MGM she played the irrepressibly snobbish Caroline Bingley, who sets her sights on Darcy (Laurence Olivier) in the classic Jane Austen film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (1940). Besides competing with (and losing out) to Greer Garson in that film, she played the ""other woman"" in Beauty for the Asking (1939), starring Lucille Ball.When her career started to lose steam, Frieda returned to New York and the Broadway stage with matronly parts in Soldier's Wife"" (1944), ""The Mermaids Singing"" (1945) and George Bernard Shaw's successful revival of ""You Never Can Tell"" (1948). After the tour of the Shaw play folded, she returned to Hollywood. Finding it difficult to pick up where she left off in films, Frieda focused on the relatively new medium of TV in the early 1950s. She appeared as Mrs. Archer on the Meet Corliss Archer (1950) series (based on the popular bobbysoxer's radio program) but was replaced by Irene Tedrow in its second and final season. She also graced a number of dramatic TV showcases. The films she made later that decade, including The She-Creature (1956), Senior Prom (1958), and Juke Box Rhythm (1959), were largely dismissed by the critics.While filming her last picture, The Crowded Sky (1960), for Warner Bros., Frieda began experiencing health problems. She was quickly diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. By the next year, she was forced to retire and had to walk with the aid of a cane. Things got worse that year when her husband, who had grown despondent over personal and financial issues, committed suicide with an overdose of pills at their California home on August 2, 1961. By the mid-1960s, the former actress was virtually incapacitated and confined to a wheelchair but valiantly worked for the multiple sclerosis association when she could muster the strength. In 1973, she moved permanently into the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where she died at age 74 on February 21, 1976."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114034/bio	"Born in Hayward, California as Kimberlin Ann Brown, Brown made daytime television history by successfully crossing over her character from the number one daytime drama The Young and the Restless (1973) to The Bold and the Beautiful (1987) causing the latter show's ratings to skyrocket in the early 1990s. Discovered by famed modeling agent Nina Blanchard, it took almost a year of soul-searching for Brown to decide if she really wanted to give up her dream of being an architect, before she moved to Los Angeles. The modeling work came quickly, and Brown jetted off to model in Tokyo, Milan and Paris. Upon her return to the United States, Brown decided to give acting a try. She guest starred on numerous television series, including Matt Houston (1982) and T.J. Hooker (1982) while taking acting classes. Brown soon won a recurring part on the daytime drama Capitol (1982). In addition, she had featured roles in the films Who's That Girl (1987), 18 Again! (1988), and Eye of the Tiger (1986). Brown's big break came in 1990: Jill Newton, the casting director of The Young and the Restless, remembered Brown from a previous audition and called her in for the role of nurse Sheila Carter. Originally designed as a minor recurring player, Brown's talents were quickly realized by the show's creator William J. Bell and culminated in a 1992 Daytime Emmy Award nomination as 'Best Supporting Actress'. As the role of Sheila Carter expanded to a full-flexed villain amidst a baby-snitch storyline along-side Tracey E. Bregman's Lauren Fenmore, the character was eventually ""killed off"" in dramatic fashion in May 1992. Little did viewers know, that the genius of William J. Bell saw a new lease of light for the character on sister-show The Bold And The Beautiful: A very much alive Sheila showed up in fictional Los Angeles where she was linked to the powerful Forrester dynasty. The rivalry of Sheila and Lauren continued to play a pivotal role in Los Angeles as well as Genoa City for another three years creating several story-lines spanning both shows. Brown's character was eventually reformed and continued in another direction until her shocking exit in October 1998. In 1999, Brown started a three-year-run as psychologist Dr. Rachel Locke on Port Charles (1997) - and no stranger to cross-over series-events - also brought this character to life on mother-show General Hospital (1963) on several occasions. In a top-secret move, Brown then made a highly publicized surprise return to The Bold And The Beautiful in May 2002. Due to a change of storyline, Brown was written off after just 6 months when the character of Sheila shot another legacy character, Dr. Taylor as played by Hunter Tylo. Following another quick return visit in 2003, Brown landed the role of Dr. Paige Miller on New York-based One Life to Live (1968), but left the show after several months to return to the role of Sheila Carter in August 2005. But this time, Brown returned to her original stomping grounds on The Young And The Restless. However, changes in storyline cut her return short and Brown was written off a mere 6 months later. In following years, scheduling conflicts prevented Brown from reprising her legacy character which was eventually killed off. In the last couple of years, Brown has starred in several independent movie productions and played a lead role on web-serial The Bay (2010) in 2011 in addition to starting her own interior design firm in 2012 in San Diego, California. Brown is married to Gary Pelzer since May 11, 1991 and they share a daughter and son."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448765/bio	Vivacious, hazel-eyed, strawberry-haired Jean Kent was a popular star of British films in the 1940's and early 50's. The daughter of variety performers Norman Field and Nina Norre, she was convent-educated. By the age of ten, she accompanied her mother on tour, then spent several years in the chorus line at London's Windmill Theatre in the West End. Having honed her acting skills on the provincial repertory stage, Jean signed with Gainsborough Pictures in 1943. Her first noteworthy performance was in Man of Evil (1944) for which she received fifth billing. Through sheer determination and hard work, she quickly moved up the ladder to integral roles as willful 'scarlet women' in juicy melodramas. These were often parts other leading actresses refused to play, point in case her gypsy wildcat Rosal in Caravan (1946), considered even by Margaret Lockwood as 'too awful'. Using her training to best advantage, Jean performed some striking dance numbers in the film.She was the femme fatale wartime audiences loved to hate, an early British sex symbol, most effectively paired with the likes of Stewart Granger or James Mason. In one of her best-remembered performances, Jean took sole limelight as the titular star of the cautionary drama Good-Time Girl (1948), as a juvenile delinquent who falls in with spivs and gangsters and ends up in prison. However, within just a few years, Jean's box-office appeal had waned, possibly attributable to having portrayed a woman ten years older than herself in The Browning Version (1951) (though the film itself was a box-office and critical success). Her remaining screen career was thereafter confined to appearances on the small screen, from the much-derided soap opera Crossroads (1964), to playing Queen Elizabeth I in the excellent Sir Francis Drake (1961) or as Daphne Goodlace, potential seductress of both Albert and Harold, in Steptoe and Son (1962).

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002136/bio	"The man behind the low woodwinds that open Citizen Kane (1941), the shrieking violins of Psycho (1960), and the plaintive saxophone of Taxi Driver (1976) was one of the most original and distinctive composers ever to work in film. He started early, winning a composition prize at the age of 13 and founding his own orchestra at the age of 20. After writing scores for Orson Welles's radio shows in the 1930s (including the notorious 1938 ""The War of the Worlds"" broadcast), he was the obvious choice to score Welles's film debut, Citizen Kane (1941), and, subsequently, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), although he removed his name from the latter after additional music was added without his (or Welles's) consent when the film was mutilated by a panic-stricken studio. Herrmann was a prolific film composer, producing some of his most memorable work for Alfred Hitchcock, for whom he wrote nine scores. A notorious perfectionist and demanding (he once said that most directors didn't have a clue about music, and he blithely ignored their instructions--like Hitchcock's suggestion that Psycho (1960) have a jazz score and no music in the shower scene). He ended his partnership with Hitchcock after the latter rejected his score for Torn Curtain (1966) on studio advice. He was also an early experimenter in the sounds used in film scores, most famously The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), scored for two theremins, pianos, and a horn section; and was a consultant on the electronic sounds created by Oskar Sala on the mixtrautonium for The Birds (1963). His last score was for Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) and died just hours after recording it. He also wrote an opera, ""Wuthering Heights"", and a cantata, ""Moby Dick""."
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366063/bio	"When it comes to motion picture special effects, there is only one name that personifies movie magic--Ray Harryhausen. From his debut films with George Pal to his final film, Harryhausen imbued magic and visual strength to motion picture special effects as no other technician has, before or since.Born in Los Angeles, the signature event in Harryhausen's life was when he saw King Kong (1933). So awed was the 13-year-old Harryhausen that he began researching the film's effects work, ultimately learning all he could about Willis H. O'Brien and stop-motion photography--he even contacted O'Brien and showed an allosaur short he made, which caused O'Brien to quip to his wife, ""You realize you're encouraging my competition, don't you?"" Harryhausen tried to make a stop-motion epic, titled ""Evolution"", but the time required to make it resulted in it being cut short. The footage he completed--of a lumbering apatosaurus attacked by a belligerent allosaurus--made excellent use as a demo reel, and as a result Harryhausen's first film job came with George Pal, working on Pal's Puppetoon shorts for Paramount. A stint in the army utilized Harryhausen's animation skills for training films.After World War II Harryhausen acquired over 1000 feet of unused military film and made a series of Puppetoon-flavored fairy tale shorts, which helped him land a job with Willis H. O'Brien and Marcel Delgado on Mighty Joe Young (1949). Although O'Brien received credit for it, 85% of the actual animation was done by Harryhausen. Harryhausen's real breakthrough, however, came when he was hired by Warner Brothers to do the special effects for The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953). The film's $200,000 budget meant that Harryhausen would be forced to improvise to get the kinds of quality effects he wanted, and to that end he learned a technique called ""split-screen"" (rear projection on overlapping miniature screens) to insert dinosaurs and other fantastic beasts into real-world backgrounds. The result was one of the most influential sci-fi films of the 1950s.From there Harryhausen went over to Columbia and teamed with producer Charles H. Schneer, the teaming becoming synonymous among sci-fi and fantasy film aficionados with top-notch special effects work the remainder of their respective careers. After three sci-fi monster films and work with Willis O'Brien on an Irwin Allen documentary, Harryhausen did the effects work for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), his first split-screen film shot entirely in color, which was highlighted by Harryhausen's mythological monsters interacting with Kathryn Grant, Torin Thatcher's flavorful performance as the villain and the rousing score of Bernard Herrmann.Because Harryhausen worked alone on his stop-motion animation sequences, the filming of these could often take as long as two years, the most famous example of the kind of patience required being the exciting skeleton sword fight sequence in Jason and the Argonauts (1963) (his most popular film) in which Harryhausen often shot no more than 13 frames of film (one-half second of elapsed time) per day.The 1960s were Harryhausen's best years, among the highlights being his reunions with dinosaurs in Hammer Films' One Million Years B.C. (1966) and The Valley of Gwangi (1969). His pace slowed in the 1970s, but he produced three of his masterworks during that period: The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973); Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977) and Clash of the Titans (1981). It was not until 1992 that Harryhausen finally achieved film immortality with an honorary Oscar, a long-overdue tribute to the one name that personifies visual magic."

In the late 1960s and early '70s, he became the quintessential ""new Hollywood"" executive, with: slickly packaged productions like Rosemary's Baby (1968), Love Story (1970) and The Godfather (1972) revived Paramount.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913095/bio	"Reedy and regal actress Ruth Warrick will be remembered for two names and two names alone. In films, she will indelibly be referred to as the castoff first ""Mrs. Citizen Kane,"" and on TV she will forever be synonymous with her character of Phoebe Tyler Wallingford, the obnoxiously wealthy, viper-tongued, manipulative and meddlesome Pine Valley grande dame who held court for 35 years until her death in 2005.Born in St. Joseph, Missouri in 1915, Ruth moved to Kansas City while in high school and later studied at the University of Kansas City. An essay contest winner, a resulting promotional tour brought her to New York where her interest in acting was increasingly piqued. Stage-trained in New York, she appeared in such plays as ""Bury the Dead"" (1933) and was a radio singer at one point. She met her first husband during one her many broadcasts. This in turn led her to Orson Welles and his Mercury Theater, and the rest is history. In 1941 Welles escorted her and his company of members to Hollywood...and major stardom.Exclusively chosen by Welles to make her ladylike debut as Emily Norton Kane in what most consider the greatest American film of all time, she followed Citizen Kane (1941) with nearly two dozen films, most of which were ""B"" melodramas and rugged adventures. She could play the altruistic wife with stoic ease but enjoyed more enthusiastic notices when controlling, tightly-wound or neurotic. Appearing with some of Hollywood's most illustrious male and female stars, she played a countess opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in The Corsican Brothers (1941); co-starred with Mercury Theater compatriots Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead and Everett Sloane in the classic film noir Journey Into Fear (1943); and starred in several war-themed movies including Secret Command (1944) with Chester Morris, Mr. Winkle Goes to War (1944) with Edward G. Robinson, and China Sky (1945), with 'Randolph Scott' (I). Post-war credits tended to regress her to second lead status opposite the likes of Joan Crawford and Ingrid Bergman, yet she still managed a few top femme roles in such films as Driftwood (1947) and One Too Many (1950), the latter in which she played an alcoholic.The focus of Ruth's career switched to the ""Golden Age"" of TV in the 1950s. Aside from her many live dramatic showcases, she made a lasting mark in daytime soap opera. Her tight-lipped matrons on Guiding Light (1952) and As the World Turns (1956) were only a warm-up for her once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of one of daytime's most dominant, colorful and enduring characters. Cast on All My Children (1970) from the show's inception, Phoebe Tyler became a clear and instant favorite -- the lady you relished hating. Her priggish socialite character carried strong story lines for nearly two decades until advancing age and failing health restricted her time. Her well-received (and aptly titled) autobiography ""The Confessions of Phoebe Tyler"" (1980) chronicled the lives of both her and her alter-ego. Prime time also made use of Ruth's sudsy-styled talent as her Emmy nomination for the role of Hannah Cord in Peyton Place (1964) will attest.Making her Broadway debut with ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" in 1957, Ruth's talents also included singing and, in between on-screen assignments, enjoyed the musical stage now and then. She understudied in ""Take Me Along"" (1959) with Jackie Gleason and in 1973 enjoyed a successful return to Broadway with the revival of ""Irene"" starring Debbie Reynolds. In regional and summer theater she starred in ""Dial M for Murder,"" ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" among others. She also toured as Anna in ""The King and I"" and appeared in the musicals ""Pal Joey"" and ""Roberta.""Her life, however, was not dedicated to just on-camera pursuits. On the contrary, long active in arts-in-education programs, including programs for the disadvantaged, Ruth received the first national Arts in Education Award in 1983 from the Board of Directors of Business and Industry for Arts in Education, Inc. The award was subsequently named the Ruth Warrick Award for Arts in Education and continued to be given annually. In 1991, she received her certification as a licensed metaphysical teacher. In her senior years, she became an avid spokesperson for the rights of senior citizens as well as the disabled, and was appointed to the U.N. World Women's Committee on Mental Health.In frail health in later years, the still feisty, five times married-and-divorced actress made occasional appearances on her beloved daytime show, even while confined to a wheelchair after a serious fall in 2001. She made her final appearance on the show in early January, 2005 to commemorate its 35th anniversary, and passed away shortly after at age 89 of complications from pneumonia."

In 1950, at the age of 31, Slim married Margaret Elizabeth Harmon and that same year he was given a role in a western, Rocky Mountain (1950). He quickly found a niche in both comic and villainous roles in that genre. With his hoarse voice and pronounced western twang, he was not always easy to cast outside the genre, but when he was, as in ""Dr. Strangelove"", the results were often memorable. He died in 1983 after a long and courageous battle against a brain tumor. He was survived by his wife Margaret and children."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006820/bio	"Aleks Paunovic was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to a Croatian mother and Serbian father. The result of this remarkable blend of bloodlines is the 6'5"" ruggedly handsome actor appearing on screens around the world at a rapidly escalating rate.Acting came to Aleks while he was onstage in his hometown playing in a heavy metal band, his livelihood since he was 16. Remarkably the role offered was one completely against type as it was that of Roddy McDowall's butler in the 1994 TV movie 'Heads'. Now bitten with the acting bug, Aleks combined his athleticism from his lifetime of boxing - he claims that he started boxing in the womb as all of the men in his family are boxers - and turned it into a very busy career as a stunt actor.In 2001 Aleks stopped in Vancouver on his way to Los Angeles with an impressive resume and ready to take on Hollywood when the most horrible event in America's recent history struck. 911 changed the way anyone could enter the states and so Aleks found himself a new home and career in busy Vancouver.Since coming to Vancouver Aleks has built an amazing resume with over 100 credits, most of which are lead and recurring roles like the one that he has on this hugely anticipated 4th season of 'Continuum'.Aleks credits three occurrences as the game-changers in his rocketing career: One was when the venerable acting coach Larry Moss called him out in front of 300 actors, telling him that he had massive talent and demanding to see his full range; another was when he respectfully declined an offer for a 4-episode-arc on a highly-rated TV series so that he could finish his run as 'Danny' in the play ""Danny and the Deep Blue Sea"" in a shaky old theatre to sold-out crowds.But the biggest catalyst in Aleks's career was when he fought three rounds of casting throughout all of Los Angeles and Vancouver to win the role of 'Tom', a developmentally disabled man accused of murder in 'Personal Effects' starring Ashton Kutcher, Michelle Pfieffer, and Kathy Bates. Aleks put on 65 pounds to perform the role, which was one of the most challenging and rewarding roles of his career so far.When you meet Aleks, or you watch him perform these difficult roles, you just know that with all of that leading man charisma there's star power in this man, and that you will be seeing a lot more of Aleks Paunovic."

His real breakthrough came in the dynamic film The Buddy Holly Story (1978), with Busey taking the lead role as Buddy Holly, in addition to playing guitar and singing all the vocals! His stellar performance scored him a Best Actor nomination and the attention of Hollywood taking overcasting agents. Next up, he joined fellow young actors William Katt and Jan-Michael Vincent as surfing buddies growing up together in the cult surf film Big Wednesday (1978), directed by John Milius.

Further strong roles followed, including alongside Danny Glover once again in Predator 2 (1990).

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796518	Anne Rivers Siddons is an American novelist who writes Southern Literature, novels that are set in the Southern States of America. Her bestseller, 'Heartbreak Hotel' - Heart of Dixie (1989) - was adapted to film starring Ally Sheedy , Phoebe Cates , Virginia Madsen and Peter Berg . Interestingly, Siddons' 1978 novel, ''The House Next Door'', falls into the horror genre, an uncharacteristic step for the author. The book is similar to Shirley Jackson 's The Haunting (1963), in that it features a house that is more than just haunted; the house itself is seemingly alive; and yet, the demonic force that has possessed the structure is left unknown, thus sustaining the ambiguity which makes The House Next Door (2006) such a chilling tale. Stephen King , in his book 'Danse Macabre', refers to Siddons' work as one of the best genre novels of the 20th century. The film adaptation stars Lara Flynn Boyle . - IMDb Mini Biography By: Matt Lee-Williams

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557751	"Actor, writer, producer and director Peter Masterston is best known for his adaptation of Larry L. King 's ""Playboy"" magazine article "" The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)"" into a smash Broadway musical, for which he received two Tony nominations. He also was the screenwriter of the underwhelming 1982 film adaptation that starred Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton . Masterston complained that Reynolds, then in full-superstar status, had tinkered with the character and dialog of the sheriff to make him more like Reynolds' own persona, thus fatally flawing the film. Before hitting it big with ""Whorehouse"", Masterston had an unspectacular career as an actor beginning in the mid-1960s and continuing through the mid-'80s, when he shifted his attentions towards directing with The Trip to Bountiful (1985). The film, which was adapted by Masterston's cousin Horton Foote from Foote's own play, was a success, earning Geraldine Page the Academy Award as Best Actress. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Jon C.

Although she was very funny in sex comedies like La mujer del zapatero (1965), Bo insisted in casting her in naturalistic melodramas.
