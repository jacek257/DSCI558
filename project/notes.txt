Main question to answer in out project:
  Q:  Can we find players in solo-queue who have the potential to do well in pro-play

Sub question that help answer main question:
  Q:  What marks a good pro-player?
  A:  Player can play multiple roles
      Player has deep champion pool
      Player consistently has high cs numbers across all champions and roles (excluding support)

  Q: What requirements are there for a champion to be part of a deep champion pool?
  A: Player needs to have a high number of games on that champion (e.g. > 20)

If 2 accounts are owned by the same player, the 2 accounts are unlikely to be in the same games
If 2 accounts have similar champion pools, the 2 accounts are likely owned by the same player
If 2 accounts play similar roles, the 2 accounts are more likely to be owned by the same players
If 2 accounts have similar cs/min, the 2 accounts are likely to be owned by the same players
